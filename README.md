PROJECT TITLE
VERNACULAR DPI ONBOARDING SUITE

A mobile prototype that helps users complete digital onboarding steps (like Aadhaar-based registration) using simple Hindi/Marathi/English voice instructions and speech recognition.

---

1. OVERVIEW

This project is a prototype of a voice-guided onboarding assistant designed for users who struggle with reading, complex UI, or digital forms.

Instead of reading long instructions, the user can:

* Speak a language name (Hindi/Marathi/English) on the Language Screen
* Hear step-by-step audio guidance (e.g., “Keep your Aadhaar ready”, “Enter your mobile number”, “Complete OTP verification”)
* Navigate between steps using simple voice commands like “Next”, “Previous”, “Aage”, “Peeche”, etc.

The system continuously records short audio chunks, sends them to a local STT (Speech-to-Text) Flask server powered by Vosk (Hindi model), and uses the recognized text to drive navigation.

This helps:

* Semi-literate / first-time smartphone users
* Rural or regional-language users
* Any user who prefers audio + voice interaction over reading long screens

Current prototype focuses on Hindi + basic Marathi/English support for instructions and UI text.

2. FEATURES

* Multilingual Language Selection via Voice

  * User can say “Hindi / Marathi / English” on the Language Screen to select language.
  * Visual mic indicator (LIVE/OFF) shows when the system is listening.

* Step-by-Step Audio Onboarding

  * Plays pre-recorded audio instructions for each step (Aadhaar ready → enter mobile → OTP verification).
  * Each language has its own audio files and text (Hindi, Marathi, English).

* Voice-Based Navigation (Next / Previous)

  * After each step audio completes (or if user pauses), the app starts “wake listening”.
  * User can say words like “haan”, “yes”, “next”, “aage”, “peeche”, “back”, etc.
  * Recognized keywords move to the next or previous instruction automatically.

* Real-Time STT using Local Flask + Vosk Server

  * App records small audio chunks (~1s) via Expo Audio API.
  * Sends them to Flask /wake endpoint.
  * Vosk Hindi ASR model returns quick transcription used for wake-words and commands.

* Visual Feedback & Micro-Interactions

  * Animated waveform bar during voice listening.
  * “You said: …” text shows what the system understood.
  * Short vibration + beep + green tick popup when a valid command is detected (success feedback).

* Multilingual UI with i18n

  * Uses i18n (react-i18next) to translate UI labels such as Back, Next, Previous, Play Instruction, Pause Instruction, You said, etc.
  * Auto-switches UI language based on selected language on the Language Screen.

* Robust Audio Handling

  * Avoids overlapping audio by carefully stopping/unloading sounds.
  * Handles pause/play correctly and restarts listening when instruction ends.

7. USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Once setup is complete:

1. Start Backend

   * Make sure stt_server.py is running.

2. Start Mobile App

   * Launch the Expo app on your phone.
   * Open the project via Expo Go.

3. Language Selection Flow

   * On the Language Screen:

     * Mic icon will pulse and show LIVE (listening).
     * Say “Hindi / Marathi / English” clearly.
     * If recognized, the app navigates automatically to the Onboarding Screen in that language.
     * Alternatively, tap the language button manually.

4. Onboarding Flow

   * Step title and description are shown (e.g., “पहला चरण – अपना आधार कार्ड तैयार रखें।” ).
   * For Hindi:

     * Instruction audio auto-plays for Step 1 when screen opens.
     * After audio finishes, the system starts listening for commands.
   * Speak commands like:

     * “haan”, “yes”, “ok”, “next”, “aage” → go to next step.
     * “peeche”, “back”, “previous” → go to previous step.
   * When a valid command is detected:

     * Short vibration
     * Beep sound
     * Green tick popup
     * Step changes after a short delay.

5. Manual Controls

   * “Play Instruction” button: replay step audio.
   * “Pause Instruction” button: pause audio, then system listens for voice commands.
   * “Back” button: exits onboarding and returns to Language Screen (stops all audio and listening).
